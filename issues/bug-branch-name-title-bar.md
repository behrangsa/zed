### Bug Description

The branch name continues to display in the title bar after the last open folder in the project/window is removed. This issue seems related to stale state from `self.project.read(cx).active_repository(cx)` in `crates/title_bar/src/title_bar.rs`, which does not return `None` after the last folder is closed. The title bar should clear the branch name when no repository is active, but currently retains it, likely due to context or event handling that does not refresh when the folder list changes.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a project with a repository.
2. Remove the last open folder in the project/window.
3. Observe that the branch name remains in the title bar.

### Expected Behavior
The title bar should clear the branch name when no repository is active.
